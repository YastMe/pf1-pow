      "value": "<p><em> You have learned how to initiate a martial strike on the move, delivering them at the end of a charge attack.</em></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a full-round action, you can make a special charge attack. First, move up to twice your speed in a straight line towards a creature, obeying the normal restrictions on movement during a charge, as well as applying any effects or benefits you might have to such movement. Then, at the end of your movement, you can initiate a strike on the creature you moved towards with an initiation action of 1 standard action. You gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls during the strike, and take a -2 penalty to your AC until the start of your next turn. During the strike, you do not gain any other benefits you would have gained for charging, such as pounce.</p>",
