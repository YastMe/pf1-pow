You first draw and resolve the trail with your primary weapon as normal, and then your offhand attack draws a second trail. You take two-weapon fighting penalties as normal for attacking with both weapons. Both paths drawn are considered to be part of the same trail, even if they may be split. The total length of both trails combined cannot exceed 10 ft. + the stated length of the trail strike, but you can otherwise divide the length between them however you wish.</p><p>If the strike grants bonus damage, only your attack with the primary weapon gains that damage, but if the strike treats a target hit as having entered the trail, both the attacks gain that effect. In addition, if a target hit by the first attack passes any saving throw that was required on entering the trail, hitting them with the offhand attack will force them to repeat the saving throw. Using this feat with a [Rain] strike as a full-round action consumes your first off-hand attack from two-weapon fighting, but does not otherwise count towards the limit of extra attacks you can make.</p>",
