      "value": "<p>A medic must be able to react immediately to any danger that threatens her allies. At 1st level, a medic gains the ability to perform a triage as a swift action. When she does, she can move up to her speed, so long as she ends her movement adjacent to an ally. That ally is healed for a number of hit points equal to three times the medic's initiator level. This increases to four times her initiator level at 7th level and five times her initiator level at 14th level. In addition, she can apply the effects of one of her medic's expertises (see @UUID[Compendium.pf1-pow.classes.Item.1jefVGmka4KQoPYT]{Medic's Expertise}) to the ally, if applicable. The medic can also perform a triage on herself; she does not move when she does so. A medic can use this ability three times per encounter at 1st level, plus one additional time per encounter at 4th level and every three levels thereafter.</p><p>Alternatively, the medic can take a full round action to apply her triage to multiple allies at once. If she does so, she can move up to twice her speed; this movement ignores difficult terrain and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Any ally that the medic is adjacent to at any point during this movement is healed for the medic's triage amount. In addition, the medic can apply the normal number of medic's expertises for a medic of her level to each healed ally. Each ally can only benefit from the full-round use of triage's healing once per use of the ability. Using triage in this way costs two uses of the ability.</p><h2>What is Triage?</h2><p>Each medic treats wounds and fatigue differently, depending on the resources available to them and the injuries and diseases they encounter. Medics are nothing if not resourceful and most will keep a pack of materials including bandages, thread, sutures, herbs or minerals that they've used or heard about using successfully to treat wounds. Medics from more technologically advanced societies might use healing gels, nanites, or other esoteric technologies in place of bandages, while more primitive societies could rely on spirit channeling herbs and leeches to get the job done. Sometimes, a medic's job isn't even really needed, and a swift word of encouragement or a jibe is enough to motivate an ally to get back into the fray. What exactly is needed to treat each character is intended to be left up to the medic's player, and should be modified to fit at each table as appropriate. However, for ease of gameplay, it is safe to assume that medics can readily keep their supplies (whatever they may be) on hand to treat their allies wounds.</p><p></p>",
