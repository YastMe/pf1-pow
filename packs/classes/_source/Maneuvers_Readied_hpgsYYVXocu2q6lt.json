      "value": "<p>A medic can ready three of her five maneuvers known at 1st level, and as she advances in level and learns more maneuvers, she is able to ready more, but must still choose which maneuvers to ready. A medic must always ready her maximum number of maneuvers readied. She readies her maneuvers by meditating or studying for ten minutes. The medic does not need to sleep or rest for any long period of time in order to ready her maneuvers; any time she spends ten minutes studying or meditating, she can change her readied maneuvers. A medic begins an encounter with all her readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times she might have already used them since she chose them. When she initiates a maneuver, she expends it for the current encounter, so each of her readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (unless she recovers them, as described below).</p><p>In order for the medic to recover maneuvers, she must reassure her allies of her presence as a full-round action. When she does so, she recovers a number of expended maneuvers equal to her medic initiation modifier (minimum 2) and grants all allies within 30 feet (including herself) a number of temporary hit points equal to 3 times her initiator level and a bonus on Fortitude saves equal to her medic initiation modifier for one round. These temporary hit points last for one minute or until lost, and stack with temporary hit points gained from other sources as normal (but not from additional uses of the medic's maneuver recovery). Alternately, the medic may take a moment to assess the situation and her allies and recover a single maneuver as a standard action. If a medic has no remaining uses of triage available and recovers medic maneuvers as a full-round action, she regains one use of triage.</p>",
