By focusing one's attention to defense with their shield, their martial skill improves their defense. The initiator gains an additional +1 bonus to his shield AC while in this stance, and this bonus increases by +1 for every 4 initiator levels he possesses after 1st level (+2 at 5th, +3 at 9th, +4 at 13th, and to a maximum of +5 at 17th level).</p>"
