The initiator makes an attack against either a target creature (inflicting damage as normal) or at the ground at a target creature's feet (friend or foe). The 5-ft. square that the target occupies or the targeted 5-ft. space itself becomes wrapped in a sheath of swirling tornado-like winds. The subject of this cannot be targeted by missile weapons of any kind (but spells can target him as normal) nor can the initiator make ranged attacks out of this storm (but spells may be cast as normal). If the creature tries to leave the area of effect of this maneuver, he must make a Reflex save (DC 14 + initiation modifier) or be forced to stay in that space, unable to make a move action or free 5-ft. step out of that space. If he succeeds or if the duration of [[1d6]] rounds expires, then the winds are dispersed and the target may act as normal. This is a supernatural ability.</p>"
