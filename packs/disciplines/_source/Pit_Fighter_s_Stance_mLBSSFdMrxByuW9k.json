Some who practice Broken Blade find those who master this particular area of the art to be of questionable honor, but none can doubt its effectiveness. While in this stance, the initiator may make one dirty trick attempt per round as a swift action without provoking attacks of opportunity, and he gains a +2 bonus to his CMD to resist dirty tricks and feint attempts. The initiator also inflicts an additional [[2d6]] points of damage whenever the target would be denied their Dexterity modifier to their AC</p>"
