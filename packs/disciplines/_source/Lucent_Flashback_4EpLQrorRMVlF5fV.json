Each creature in the area becomes flat-footed against the next attack made against them and must make a reflex save (DC 10 + one-half your initiator level + your initiation modifier) or take [[2d6]] force damage and have their senses overloaded. A creature has a -2 penalty to this saving throw if you have hit them with a ranged attack this turn. When overloaded, a creature cannot make attacks of opportunity, cannot see any of your trails, and all senses except smell, hearing and touch cannot perceive anything more than 15 feet away from them: they are also flat-footed against all attacks from outside this range. A creature can use a move action to refocus and remove all effects of being overloaded from themselves, but otherwise all effects end after 1 round. You may move up to 10 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity after using this maneuver.</p>"
