As a full attack action, the initiator makes an attack roll at full base attack bonus against each target within his reach with each weapon he is currently wielding (including natural attacks and armor or shield spikes), and each successful attack inflicts an additional [[6d6]] points of damage. After initiating this maneuver, the initiator's focus on offense causes his AC to suffer a -2 penalty until his next turn.</p>"
