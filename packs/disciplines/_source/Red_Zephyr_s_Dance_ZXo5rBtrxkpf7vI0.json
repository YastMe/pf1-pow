The disciple makes a melee attack at his full attack bonus against a target, and if successful, the disciple moves 10-ft. (no more or no less) and may make another attack at his next highest attack bonus. He may not make more attacks in a round than his maximum main-hand number of attacks, nor may he move farther than his normal maximum speed. For example, if a warlord with a base attack bonus of +13 initiated this maneuver, he would make one attack at +13, move 10-ft., make his second attack at +8, then move 10-ft. again, and make a final attack at +3.</p>"
