Only those who you allow to speak may do so. You may initiate this counter in response to a creature within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 initiator levels) manifesting a power, casting a spell, or using a spell-like or psi-like ability. Roll damage as if you'd made a successful attack with a weapon you're wielding; you don't deal this damage, but the target of this counter must succeed at a concentration check (DC 10 + damage that would be dealt by this attack + the level of the spell being cast or power being manifested) or lose the power, psi-like ability, spell, or spell-like ability as if it had been disrupted. Essence: Each point of essence invested into this counter increases the DC of the concentration check by 1.  </p>"
