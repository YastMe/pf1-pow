You can initiate this counter response to a melee or ranged attack being made against you. Make an attack roll with a weapon you are wielding. If your attack roll is higher than your opponent's, their attack is negated. If you drew your weapon as part of this counter, you can make an attack against your attacker. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal plus an additional [[5d6]] points of damage, and your weapon is treated as silver for the purposes of vulnerabilities and overcoming damage reduction. You cannot make this counterattack if the target is not within your melee reach or otherwise targetable with a melee attack.</p>"
