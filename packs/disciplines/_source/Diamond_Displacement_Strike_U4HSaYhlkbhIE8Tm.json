The disciple of the Silver Crane strikes hard at his opponent's senses and rips them from him decisively, burning them out with holy light and thunderous power. Make an attack, the target of which must make a Will save (DC 17 + initiation modifier) or be permanently blinded and deafened by a celestial hand. Targets that succeed their saving throw are staggered for one round from the sensory overload of the attack.</p>"
