By bringing all of his strength to bear, the Iron Tortoise disciple steps up to his foe with a devastating shield bash that sends him flying. Make a shield bash attempt which if successful inflicts an additional [[6d6]] points of damage and if the target fails a Reflex save (DC 15 + initiation modifier) knocks the opponent up to 20-ft away where he will land prone. Foes that succeed this saving throw are still pushed back 5-ft away from the disciple. The direction to where his opponent is flown is decided by the initiator.</p>"
