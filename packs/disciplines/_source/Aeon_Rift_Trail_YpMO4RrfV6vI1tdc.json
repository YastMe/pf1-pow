Make a 90-foot trail ranged attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal plus an additional [[3d6]] points of damage, and the creature hit is affected as if they entered the trail. In addition, enemies entering the trail must make a Will save (DC 14 + your initiation modifier) or immediately end their turn and move their initiative to the bottom of the turn order, changing their initiative to equal the lowest initiative among creatures in combat, minus one. This change persists for the rest of combat. When their turn comes up again that round, they may resume any actions they were in the middle of, and take their remaining actions, but this does not give them another use of any action they already took that round. If an enemy fails their save and their initiative count is not higher than any of your allies, they are instead slowed (as the Slow spell) until the end of their next turn.</p>"
