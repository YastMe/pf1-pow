You may initiate this counter upon you or an ally within range being targeted by an attack or being subjected to an effect which requires a saving throw from a tricked creature. You or the ally may swap places with a willing creature or tricked foe within range, causing them to become the new target of the attack or effect. This may even cause the tricked foe to attack themself. A tricked foe receives a Will save (DC 18 + initiation modifier) to resist the swap. This is a supernatural maneuver. Exploit: A tricked foe being swapped in does not receive a Will save. Alternatively, a creature making a full attack must complete its action against the new target. Upon using this exploit, the foe is immune to this exploit for seven rounds.</p>"
