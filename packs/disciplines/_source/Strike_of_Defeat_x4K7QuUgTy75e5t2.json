An injured foe is easy prey, but is still a foe nonetheless. By utilizing this swift executioner's strike, the Scarlet Throne disciple removes a potential threat and obstacle from his path. The disciple makes an attack against a foe which if successful deals additional damage determined by the state of the enemy's hit points. If the enemy has more than 75% of his total hit points, this strike does no additional damage. If the foe has less than 75% hit points, this strike inflicts an additional [[4d6]] points of damage. If the foe has less than 25% of his total hit points, this strike inflicts an additional [[8d6]] points of damage.</p>"
