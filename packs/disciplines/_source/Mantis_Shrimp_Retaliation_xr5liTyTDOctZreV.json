You may initiate this counter in response to a melee attack. Make a Swim check against the attack roll. If successful, you may make an attack against them before they go through with their attack. If you hit, you deal an additional [[4d6]] damage and the enemy loses the attack. This counter can be used even against natural 20s.</p><p>Call of the Deep: This counter works against ranged attacks and your melee attack can reach the attacker regardless of distance. Additionally, if the counter attack hits the target gains the off-balance condition.</p>"
