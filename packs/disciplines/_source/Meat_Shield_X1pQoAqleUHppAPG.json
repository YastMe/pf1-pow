When a creature makes a melee or ranged attack against you or you are forced to make a Reflex saving throw, you may block the threat using a creature you are grappling, gaining the benefits of improved cover. If you avoid the attack or succeed on the saving throw, the creature you are grappling is considered hit by that attack or failing his saving throw, and thus takes damage instead of you. You must be grappling a creature in order to use this counter.</p>"
