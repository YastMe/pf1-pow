You can initiate this counter in response to being targeted with a power, psi-like ability, spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability. The creature targeting you becomes unable to use that ability for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier (although the ability they targeted you with still occurs and is resolved as normal) and you gain the ability to use that ability for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier. If the ability is a spell, you can use it once as a spell-like ability. If the ability is a psionic power, you can manifest it once as a psi-like ability. Otherwise, you can use the ability as often as is detailed in the ability description. Calculate the save DCs for the ability based on your initiation modifier and treat your initiator level as your caster level, manifester level, or hit dice, as appropriate for the ability.</p>"
