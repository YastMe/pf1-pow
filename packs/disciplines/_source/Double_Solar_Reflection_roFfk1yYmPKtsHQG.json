The initiator makes a single ranged attack roll and if this roll is successful, he may apply this same attack roll against another opponent within 20-ft. of the first, and if this is also successful, he may use the same attack roll to strike a third target no farther than 20-ft. away (but not the original target). This strike inflicts an additional +[[4d6]] points to the first target, +[[2d6]] points of damage to the second, and normal damage to the third target. Each reflection attack is considered a separate attack for the purposes of determining the effectiveness of single attack boosting abilities, such as boosts that affect one attack or spells like true strike. If the ammunition had special properties, the ammunition retains its properties on each attack until the strike ends.</p>"
