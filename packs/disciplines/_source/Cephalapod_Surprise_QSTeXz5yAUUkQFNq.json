      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: One Surging Shark maneuver<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Personal<br /><strong>Target</strong>: You<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 round</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Clever and cunning, you trick your foes into futile attacks. You may initiate this counter in response to being struck by a weapon. You gain DR 30 against all attacks made by that kind of weapon (for instance, if you are struck by a longsword, you become resistant to all longsword attacks). It is not immediately obvious that you have initiated a maneuver. Instead, your foes must make a Knowledge (martial) check (DC 14 + your ranks in Swim) to notice that their blows are not harming you. They may, alternatively, make a Perception check, but the DC to do so increases by 5. Call of the Deep: When you initiate this counter, you may instead gain damage resistance to all attacks from weapons in the same weapon group as the one that struck you. If a weapon is in multiple groups, you may choose one to resist.</p>"
