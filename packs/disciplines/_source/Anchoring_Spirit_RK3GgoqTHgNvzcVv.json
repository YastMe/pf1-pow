While in this stance, the initiator gains the incorporeal subtype and anyone within 30-ft. of his position who attempts to use an effect with the [Teleportation] type likely fails. The disciple can exclude allied creatures from this effect. Those effected can attempt an opposed initiator level check (using their caster or initiator level) to successfully execute their teleportation effect. Once outside of this stance's range, creatures are no longer affected. If two or more instances of Anchoring Spirit overlap, they cease functioning until separated. This is an Ethereal plane using maneuver.</p>"
