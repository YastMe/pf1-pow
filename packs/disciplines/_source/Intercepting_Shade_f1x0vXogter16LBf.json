The initiator makes an opposed attack roll against his foe's attack roll on an incoming attack (such as an arrow or thrown weapon, a charging barbarian, or a skillful slash from a sword, but not a spell or similar attack) targeting himself or an ally he can see within his weapon's first range increment; if successful then the attack is negated.</p>"
