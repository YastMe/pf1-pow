He becomes preternaturally graceful and deadly, his dark soul assisting his movements in combat by forming an ethereal image of a hellish angelic form and wings of shadow. While in this stance, the character gains a fly speed equal to his movement speed (average maneuverability), a +2 profane bonus to AC, and he gains the use of the Whirlwind Attack feat (he does not need to meet the prerequisites for use of this feat).</p>"
