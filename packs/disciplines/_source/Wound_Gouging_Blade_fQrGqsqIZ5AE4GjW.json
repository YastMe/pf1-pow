Make an attack roll against a creature. On a successful hit, any bleed damage that the target is taking is increased by 50%, with the save DC being required to stop the bleeding increasing by 5. If the target creature is not already bleeding, it takes [[2d4]] points of bleed damage (this is not affected by the 50% increase of this maneuver). In addition, any creatures attempting to stop the bleeding using magic must make a caster level check (DC 15 + your initiator level) or else have the spell fail to stop the bleeding.</p>"
