Make an attack against a foe that inflicts an additional [[15d6]] points of damage. The disciple may also choose to strike incorporeal foes with this strike as if they were made manifest, including fiends who currently possess a creature. To strike a possessing fiend, the body they inhabit must be also struck, but all damage goes to the possessing fiend without harming the host. If used against a possessing fiend or an incorporeal creature, the creature must make a Will save (DC 18 + initiation modifier) or be instantly slain.</p>"
