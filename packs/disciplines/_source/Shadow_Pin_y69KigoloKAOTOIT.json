You can initiate this counter in response to a creature within range leaving its space (including via movement such as a being pushed by a gust of wind spell or bull rush combat maneuver, or teleportation effects). The target becomes cursed for one round and stops its movement, dropping to the ground and taking falling damage as normal if it is flying and cannot hover. In addition, the target cannot move or be moved from its space for one round. You cannot stop a creature's movement if it is within another creature's space. </p>"
