      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: Four Elemental Flux maneuvers<br /><strong>Range</strong>: 30 feet<br /><strong>Target</strong>: Up to fie creatures<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous (see text)</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The ultimate expression of elemental power can only be unleashed by a master of the Elemental Flux discipline, and by calling upon the arcane forces of magic as well as the terrific power of the elements, the disciple may crush his opponents under a fierce magical assault. The maneuver creates five distinct blasts of energy, one of each element and one of pure force. These blasts may be fired at the same or different targets, as long as each target is within 30 feet of you. Each blast requires a ranged touch attack to hit and has one of the following effects if it hits: Air A bolt of electrical energy that deals 25 points of electricity damage and staggers the opponent for [[1d4]] rounds. If the target is wearing metal armor or a metal shield, or wielding a primarily metal weapon then the attack gains a +4 circumstance bonus on hit. Earth A jet of boiling acid that deals 25 points of acid damage and blinds the target for [[1d4]] rounds. Fire A stream of sulfurous fire that deals 25 points of fire damage, nauseates the target for [[1d4]] rounds, and sets them on fire for the same duration. Force A hammering blast of arcane force that deals 50 points of force damage. Water A freezing beam of cold that deals 25 points of cold damage and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 19 + your initiation modifier) or become dazed for [[1d4]] rounds. Animus augmentation: For each blast, you may spend up to three points of animus to increase its initial damage by 10 per point of animus spent and its save DC (if any) by +1 per point of animus spent. You may spend any number of animus points to augment this strike, regardless of your level. However, each blast must be augmented separately, and you cannot spend more than three points per blast. The blasts of this strike are otherwise immutable; you cannot use abilities such as the mystic's elemental attunement class feature to change the damage types dealt.</p>"
