      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: Three Sleeping Goddess maneuvers<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Melee or ranged attack<br /><strong>Target</strong>: One creature<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous (see text)</p><h2>Description</h2><p>With your studied understanding of the mind and its motivations, beliefs, and ideals, you can temporarily subvert the spirit of a foe, briefly making them into a staunch ally. Make an attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal, and the target must succeed at a Will save (DC 18 + your initiation modifier) or fall under your complete control for one round, as if you had manifested a Geth's mind control power on them, although it can affect any creature type, not just humanoids. Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or more of the following ways: For every power point you spend, this strike deals an additional [[1d6]] points of damage. For every [[2d6]] you increase the damage by, the save DC of this strike increases by +1. If you spend 6 power points, the target is controlled for an additional round. If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this strike, you ignore any immunity to mind-affecting effects the target possesses. Instead, a normally-immune target gains a +5 resistance bonus on its saving throw.</p>"
