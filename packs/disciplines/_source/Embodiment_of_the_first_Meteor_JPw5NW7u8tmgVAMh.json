You gain a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability, or you can increase an existing fly speed by 30 feet with perfect maneuverability. At the start of each of your turns, you gain the ability to soar a number of times equal to half your initiation modifier (minimum 3), until the start of your next turn. Soaring makes you fly up to 30 feet in a straight line in any direction without provoking attacks of opportunity and is a free action. You can also soar without using an action immediately before the start of any creature's turn in initiative. Soaring extends one of your active trails, filling each space you move through with the effect of the trail which also spreads upwards and downwards as normal - these extensions from soaring only last 1 round, or when the trail they are extending ends, whichever comes first.  Whenever one of your trails would end, a chain of explosions ripples along it, and all creatures and unattended objects of your choice in the trail take force damage equal to your initiator level before the trail dissipates.  Finally, all your ranged attacks deal an additional [[1d8]] points of force damage, and when you initiate a [Rain] strike as a full-round action, you may make one additional ranged attack at your highest base attack bonus as part of it.</p>"
