You fire a ray against an opponent within 30 feet. This ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals [[3d6]] points of damage of your active element's associated energy type. This strike also has one of the following effects, based on your active element: Air If your ray hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction of your choice. Earth If your ray hits, the target takes an additional [[1d6]] points of acid damage at the start of your next turn, and must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier. Fire If your ray hits, the target must succeed at a Reflex save or take an additional [[2d6]] points of fire damage at the start of your next turn. Animus augmentation: You may spend points of animus up (up to your maximum for augmenting Elemental Flux maneuvers) to increase the initial damage of this strike by [[1d6]] per point of animus spent and increase the save DC of this strike by +1 per point of animus spent.</p>"
