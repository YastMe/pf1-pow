Make an attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal, and the target must succeed at a Will save (DC 11 + your initiation modifier) or for one round, any attacks from your allies against the target deal an additional [[1d6]] points of damage. Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or more of the following ways: For every 2 power points you spend, the additional damage your allies deal to the target increases by [[1d6]]. If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this strike, your target does not get a saving throw against it.</p>"
