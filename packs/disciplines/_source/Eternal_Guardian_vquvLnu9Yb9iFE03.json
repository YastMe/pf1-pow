      "value": "<p>The exact origins of the discipline of the Eternal Guardian are difficult to determine due to the style’s incredible age. One legend claims it was created by the god who first separated the planes, dividing the mortal from the immortal, while another story insists that it was founded by a single warrior who swore to defend his city from an entire invading army. These stories reflect the core of the discipline: A total devotion to a promise—usually either an oath to an ally that they will survive, no matter the cost to the disciple, or a curse on a foe that they will never escape. Today, the discipline of the Eternal Guardian has spread far and wide: It is used by bodyguards in the palaces of kings, sentinels of occult orders, and humble night watchmen making their rounds. The discipline of the Eternal Guardian and all of its maneuvers and stances are considered to be supernatural abilities and thus do not function in situations where supernatural abilities will fail.</p><p><strong>Curse Maneuvers</strong>: Some maneuvers in Eternal Guardian have the curse descriptor. These maneuvers, much like spells with the curse descriptor, use persistent, malicious energies to inflict penalties on their victims. A creature immune to curses is immune to the effects of these maneuvers, with the exception of any weapon damage inflicted by them.</p><p>Many of these curse maneuvers inflict a new condition: cursed. By itself, the cursed condition does nothing, but many maneuvers or abilities have an increased effect on cursed creatures, or can only be used on cursed creatures (see individual maneuver descriptions for more information on how they interact with the cursed condition). Spells with the curse descriptor also apply the cursed condition for a duration equal to the spell’s duration. Multiple applications of the cursed condition do not overlap; instead the duration of each new application of the condition is added to the remaining duration of the previous application. The successful use of break enchantment, remove curse, or similar effects removes the cursed condition from the target in addition to their normal effects</p><p><strong>Associated Skills</strong>: Intimidate </p><p><strong>Associated Weapon Groups</strong>: Hammers, heavy blades, and polearms  </p>",
