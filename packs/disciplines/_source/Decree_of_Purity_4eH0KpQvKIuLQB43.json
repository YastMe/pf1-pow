When you initiate this maneuver, you may choose to grant a single ally within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 initiator levels) a saving throw against an ongoing effect on them that offers multiple saving throws over time to negate, or has its duration measured in rounds at the effect's original DC. They gain a bonus on this saving throw equal to your initiation modifier (minimum 2). If it succeeds, the effect ends. This does not progress poison, diseases, or similar effects on a failed saving throw.  In addition, you may heal yourself and allies within close range for a total number of hit points equal to five times your initiation modifier, divided as you choose between you and your allies. Essence: Each point of essence invested into this boost increases the total amount of healing done by 7 hit points. This healing is split up between targets normally.</p>"
