Make a melee attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal, and you can make another melee attack with a -4 penalty on your attack roll. If that attack hits, you can make a further melee attack at a -8 penalty. You continue to repeat this process, taking a cumulative -4 penalty for each additional attack, until you miss an attack or you reduce your target to 0 or fewer hit points. You must direct all of these attacks at the same creature.</p>"
