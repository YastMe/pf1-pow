When you are targeted by a ranged touch attack or any other effect which would fire a non-solid projectile (such as laser weapons or other energy weapons), make a Disable Device check opposed by the attack roll of the effect. If you succeed, the attack turns on a target of your choice within range, targeting their AC and on a hit dealing damage as if they had been originally targeted (spell resistance still applies).</p>"
