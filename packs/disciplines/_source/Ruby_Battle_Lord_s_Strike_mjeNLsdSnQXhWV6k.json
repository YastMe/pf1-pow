The disciple initiating Ruby Battle Lord's Strike must make a full attack against a target, each attack using his full base attack bonus with a +2 insight bonus instead of the normal -5 reduction of each consecutive attacks (i.e. an initiator with a base attack bonus of +16, who normally has four attacks in a full attack action, would make each attack using this maneuver using his full +16 base attack bonus with a +2 insight bonus in addition).</p>"
