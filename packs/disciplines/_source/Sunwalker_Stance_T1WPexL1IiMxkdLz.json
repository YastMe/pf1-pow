The initiator gains the benefits of the Shot on the Run feat (As a full-round action, you can move up to your speed and make a single ranged attack at any point during your movement) while in this stance (he does not need to meet the prerequisites of this feat), and he gains a +2 circumstance bonus to his armor class against attacks if he moves more than 10-ft. during his turn.</p>"
