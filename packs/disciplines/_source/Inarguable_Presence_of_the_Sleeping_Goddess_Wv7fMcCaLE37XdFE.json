You are a fact, and your power will not be denied. While you maintain this stance, your maneuvers and other abilities treat creatures that are normally immune to mind-affecting effects as if they were not immune. Such creatures gain a +5 resistance bonus on saving throws against your mind-affecting effects, rather than ignoring them outright. In addition, attacks made against you suffer a 20% miss chance.</p>"
