The initiator makes an attack against either a target creature inflicting an additional [[6d6]] damage to the target or at the ground at a target creature's feet. The 5-ft. square that the target occupies or the targeted 5-ft. space itself immediately sets of a powerful wave of air that potentially knocks enemies prone within a 15-ft. radius of the target on a failed Fortitude saving throw (DC 16 + initiation modifier; this including the target, who suffers a -4 penalty to this saving throw). This is a supernatural ability.</p>"
