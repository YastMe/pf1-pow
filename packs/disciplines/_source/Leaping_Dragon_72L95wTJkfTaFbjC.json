The disciple of the Thrashing Dragon uses this technique to suddenly launch himself into the air as if he were attempting flight. The initiator may make an Acrobatics check to jump as a swift action, and he gains a +10 competence bonus to his Acrobatics check and is treated as if he had a running start.</p>"
