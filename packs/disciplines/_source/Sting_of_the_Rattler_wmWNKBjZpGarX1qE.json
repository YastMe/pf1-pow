By focusing this harmful energy into a single attack, the disciple may cause more grievous injuries than his opponent would register immediately. The disciple makes an attack and if successful, inflicts an additional [[1d4]] points of damage. The following round on the disciple's turn, the enemy takes an additional [[1d4]] points of damage due to the venomous ki that has built up in the wound. This is a supernatural ability.</p>"
