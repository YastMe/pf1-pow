The initiator picks a target creature or area as if he were using a grenade like weapon and a 20-ft. burst of burning phantom ammunition crashes down on this area, inflicting [[10d6]] points of damage and [[10d6]] points of fire damage. The targets in the area of effect may make a Reflex save (DC 19 + initiation modifier) to reduce the damage by half. On a failed save, the targets are knocked prone from the force of the attack. This maneuver creates its own ammunition.</p>"
