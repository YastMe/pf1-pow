You can initiate this maneuver when you are targeted or otherwise affected by an effect that requires a Will save. You gain a +4 bonus on that saving throw, and if you succeed, the originator of the effect becomes stunned for one round. Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or more of the following ways: For every 2 power points you spend, the bonus on your Will save increases by +1. If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this counter, the originator of the effect is dazed for one round if you succeed on your Will save, rather than stunned. The creature still drops held items, takes a -2 penalty to its AC, and loses its Dexterity bonus to its AC (if any) as if it were stunned.</p>"
