As part of this strike, you may move up to your speed. At any point in this movement, you can make a lock attempt against a creature within your reach. If you successfully lock them, you drag them along with you without the normal penalty to your movement speed. When your movement ends, you can take an attack action (such as Vital Strike) or initiate a readied strike with an initiation action of 1 standard action against that creature. If you initiate a strike, it is expended as normal. Your movement during this strike provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, except from the target.</p>"
