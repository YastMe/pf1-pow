Make a melee touch attack. If it hits, the target disappears from reality for [[1d4]] rounds. After this duration, the target reappears in exactly the same orientation and condition as before. From the target's point of view, no time has passed at all. If the space from which the target departed is occupied upon his return to the time stream, he appears in the closest unoccupied space, still in his original orientation. Determine the closest space randomly if necessary. A successful Will save (DC 17 + your initiation modifier) reduces the duration of this strike to one round.</p>"
