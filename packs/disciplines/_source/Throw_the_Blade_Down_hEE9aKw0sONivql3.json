The initiator makes an opposed Acrobatics check against the target's attack roll. If successful the initiator makes an immediate 5-ft. step to an adjacent square and the attacker moves 5-ft. to occupy his former square and the attacker must make a Reflex save (DC 15 + initiation modifier) to resist falling prone. The initiator may not use this counter on targets that are more than one size category larger than he is and neither 5-ft step provokes an attack of opportunity.</p>"
