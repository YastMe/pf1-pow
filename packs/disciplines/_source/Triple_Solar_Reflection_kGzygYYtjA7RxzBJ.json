      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: Two Solar Wind maneuvers<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Ranged attack<br /><strong>Target</strong>: Up to four creatures, see description<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The Solar Wind disciple has mastered the art of the ricochet shot and may target up to four attackers. The initiator makes a single ranged attack roll and if this roll is successful, he may apply this same attack roll against another opponent within 20-ft. of the first, and if this is also successful, he may use the same attack roll to strike a third target no farther than 20- ft. away (but not the original target), and again on a fourth target no farther than 20-ft. from the last. This strike inflicts an additional +[[6d6]] points to the first target, +[[4d6]] points of damage to the second, +[[2d6]] on the third, and normal damage to the fourth, and final, target. Each reflection attack is considered a separate attack for the purposes of determining the effectiveness of single attack boosting abilities, such as boosts that affect one attack or spells like true strike. If the ammunition had special properties, the ammunition retains its properties on each attack until the strike ends.</p>"
