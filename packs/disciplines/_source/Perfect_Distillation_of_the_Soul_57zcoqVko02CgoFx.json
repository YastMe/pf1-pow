      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: Two Sleeping Goddess maneuvers<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Personal<br /><strong>Target</strong>: You<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 round/level (see text)</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Your soul's blade is unparalleled in form, shining as a beacon of your will and ideals, and carving through your foes as well as even the most powerful magic weapons. When you initiate this boost, a soul's blade appears in your hands, taking the form of a +5 melee weapon you are proficient with. Alternatively, you may create two soul's blades, each taking the form of an identical +4 melee weapons you are proficient with. A soul's blade created with this boost has hardness 20 and 50 hit points. Th blade lasts a number of rounds equal to your initiator level before vanishing. If you throw your soul's blade or otherwise relinquish your grip on it (such as by being disarmed), it dissipates after one round dissipates after one round unless you reclaim it. You can have multiple soul's blades created at once if you initiate this boost or other boosts that create a soul's blade multiple times, although only as many as you can wield. If you are currently wielding a mind blade or equivalent weapon (such as a deadly fit's empowered strikes, a psychic armory's panoply of blades, or a soulbolt's mind bolt), you can choose to amplify it instead of this boost's normal effects. Until the start of your next turn, all such weapons you wield (including those created after initiating this boost) gain the benefit of a single weapon special ability equivalent to up to +3 enhancement bonus. This ability must be chosen from the list of weapon special abilities you can normally place on your mind blade (see Mind Blade Enhancements).</p>"
