When you initiate this boost, make a Bluff check. For the duration of this boost, every time a creature damages you, they must make a Perception check opposed by the result of your Bluff check. If they do not beat your result, they become shaken for one round and think that you have taken no damage from the attack even when you have. While the effects of this counter remain active, you continue to threaten squares as normal for the purpose of flanking.</p>"
