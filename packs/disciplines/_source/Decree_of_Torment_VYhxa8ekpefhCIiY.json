      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: None<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Melee or ranged attack<br /><strong>Target</strong>: One creature<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous (see text)</p><h2>Description</h2><p>You strike with an akashic brand that imbalances a creature. Make an attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal and the target becomes branded with a number of akashic brands equal to your initiation modifier. These brands last for one minute or until otherwise consumed. When a creature attacks another creature that has been branded this way, they may remove one of the brands as a part of the attack to attempt a combat maneuver of their choice against the branded creature. Ranged attackers may not choose to grapple or move with the target if the combat maneuver would normally allow it (such as if using a bull rush), but may otherwise freely select combat maneuvers. When determining their combat maneuver bonus for this strike, creatures may use your initiator level in place of their base attack bonus, and may choose to use your initiation modifier in place of their Strength modifier. Each creature may remove only one brand per round. These combat maneuvers do not provoke an attack of opportunity. Essence: Each point of essence invested into this strike lowers the branded creature's CMD by 1 for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier.</p>"
