Make a melee attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal plus an additional [[8d6]] points of damage. If you drew your weapon as part of this strike, your attack is treated as silver for the purposes of vulnerability, automatically overcomes damage reduction, and suppresses any fast healing or regeneration the target has for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier. This strike cannot suppress regeneration that is not overcome by any type of damage, such as that possessed by a tarrasque. This maneuver is a supernatural ability.</p>"
