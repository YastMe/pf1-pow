The disciple of this discipline learns to use this inspirational creature's weakness as a potent weapon by making a low and powerful strike that may knock his opponent prone. As part of this maneuver, the initiator makes a single melee attack. If this attack is successful, he may initiate a free trip attempt with a +2 competence bonus against his opponent that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>"
