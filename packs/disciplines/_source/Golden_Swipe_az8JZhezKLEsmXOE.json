The initiator makes a melee attack, inflicting an additional [[6d6]] points of damage and forcing his foe to make a 10-ft. movement (if the target is capable of moving) from the square he is currently occupying in a direction of his choosing. If the target is incapable of movement, then the target simply takes the damage as normal. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity to all those capable of making them against the target except for the initiator of this maneuver.</p>"
