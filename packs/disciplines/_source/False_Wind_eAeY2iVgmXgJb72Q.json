You can initiate this counter in response to an attack being made against you or an ally by a creature you can see. Make a ranged attack against that creature. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal, and the ally targeted by the creature you attacked can move up to their speed as a free action, even if it isn't their turn. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>"
