These disciples know that so long as their foe is destroyed, pain is inconsequential. By summoning forth this rage and channeling it through their form, they may will a lance of venomous rage and pain into existence and fling at their enemy. This is a ranged touch attack which deals [[8d6]] points of profanedamage and stuns a foe for one round with wracking pain (Fortitude save DC 15 + initiation modifier negates the stunnedcondition).</p>"
