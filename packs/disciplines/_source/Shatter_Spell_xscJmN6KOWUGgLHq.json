Make an attack or touch a willing target. If the attack hits, it deals weapon damage as normal plus an additional [[2d6]] points of damage (A willing target does not take damage from this strike). Either way, the target is aï¬€ected by a targeted dispel magic as if you had cast it, using your initiator level as your caster level. This strike can also dispel curses as if using remove curse. Essence: Each point of essence invested into this strike increases the result of the caster level check by 2.</p>"
