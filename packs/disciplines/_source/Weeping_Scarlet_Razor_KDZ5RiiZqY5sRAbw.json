The Scarlet Throne disciple takes this knowledge and arms himself with his superior skill to utilize this arterial strike against his foes. The initiator makes a melee attack against a target creature, and if successful, this attack inflicts an additional [[4d6]] points of damage and the target begins to bleed profusely, inflicting 4 points of bleed damage per round until a successful Heal check (DC 20) or a spell or effect that cures hit point damage has been administered to the target.</p>"
