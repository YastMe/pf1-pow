By learning to manipulate his ki flows to obscure his movements from sight and hearing, using his body-control to mask the signs of his passage. The disciple may add his ranks in the Heal skill to his ranks in the Stealth skill when making a Stealth check while in this stance as a competence bonus. While in this stance, when making an attack against a flat-footed opponent or one that has been denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, the disciple gains a +4 competence bonus to attack rolls and inflicts an additional [[1d6]] points of damage. This is a supernatural ability.</p>"
