You can initiate this counter in response to a melee or ranged attack being made against you or an ally by an opponent within 60 feet. Make an Intimidate check, using the creature's attack roll as the DC. If you succeed, the attack is negated, and that all attacks made by that creature until the end of its turn are treated as if that creature had rolled a natural 1.</p>"
