The initiator may ignore environmental variables such as high winds and storm and rain that would cause the initiator to suffer penalties to his attack rolls, magically created (such as wall of wind or control weather) or naturally caused such as in a gale force wind), when making ranged attacks for one round. This is a supernatural ability.</p>"
