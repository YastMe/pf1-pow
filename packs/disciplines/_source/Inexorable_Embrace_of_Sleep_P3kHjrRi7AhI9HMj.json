      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: One Sleeping Goddess maneuver<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Melee or ranged attack<br /><strong>Target</strong>: One creature<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous (see text)</p><h2>Description</h2><p>With a devastating psychic strike, you can render a foe's higher mind catatonic, reducing him to the state of a sleepwalker. Make an attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal plus an additional [[2d6]] points of damage, and the target must succeed at a Will save (DC 13 + your initiation modifier) or be forced into a dreamlike trance for three rounds. While in this trance, the target cannot activate spell-like or supernatural abilities, cast spells, manifest powers, use psi-like abilities, or initiate maneuvers. Supernatural abilities that do not require an action or require only a free action to activate are unaffected, and spells and powers that the target is already concentrating on can be concentrated on as normal. The target may otherwise act normally, moving attacking, and performing other actions as it sees fit. Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or more of the following ways: For every power point you spend, this strike deals an additional [[1d6]] points of damage. For every [[2d6]] you increase the damage by, the save DC of this strike increases by +1. If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this strike, your target does not get a saving throw against it. However, the duration of the trance is reduced to one round rather than three.</p>"
