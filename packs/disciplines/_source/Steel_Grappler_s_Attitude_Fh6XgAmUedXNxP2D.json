While in this stance, the initiator counts as one size category larger when calculating CMB and CMD for grapple, bull rush, and overrun attempts, for use during counters, and he may add his initiation modifier to his CMB checks and to his CMD for grapple, bull rush, and overrun attempts and resisting those that use those combat maneuvers against him.</p>"
