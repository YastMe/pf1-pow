Pressing forward with infernally enhanced power, the disciple moves to devastate his next foe with the rage within his soul. The disciple makes a charge attack which does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and this inflicts an additional [[8d6]] points of damage and leaves his foe sickenedfor [[1d4]] rounds. If the victim successfully makes a Fortitude save (DC 16 + initiation modifier), he negates the sickened condition. When making a charge attack with this strike, he does not suffer the standard -2 Armor Class penalty.</p>"
