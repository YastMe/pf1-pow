You've learned to steal the advantage when you find yourself unarmed versus an armed opponent. You can initiate this counter in response to a melee or ranged attack being made against you. Make a Climb check, using your opponent's attack roll as the DC. If you succeed, the attack is negated. If the attack was made with a melee weapon, you can make a disarm attempt against your attacker, using your Climb check's result in place of your combat maneuver check. This disarm attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity, and if you successfully disarm your attacker and have a free hand, you may catch the weapon. If you used this counter to negate a ranged attack with a weapon, you instead catch that weapon or piece of ammunition (you need not attempt a disarm).</p>"
