      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: Four Sleeping Goddess maneuvers<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Melee or ranged attack<br /><strong>Target</strong>: One creature<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Standing at the pinnacle of the Sleeping Goddess discipline's students, you have the ability to share your beliefs in a way that no others can. By making contact with your opponent's mind and soul, you can open a dialogue, communicating your respective ideals instantaneously and debating their merits. Make an attack. If it hits, it deals an additional [[10d6]] points of damage. If this damage would reduce the target to 0 or fewer hit points, you can attempt to convert them to your way of thinking, clashing beliefs in a brief moment of spiritual contact. If you do, you and the target make an opposed ability check, with you using your initiation modifier and the target using its Charisma modifier. If the target succeeds, they take damage as normal, potentially killing them or knocking them unconscious. If you succeed, the target is instead reduced to 1 hit point, and their attitude towards you and your allies changes to helpful. This is not a compulsion, nor is it forcing the target to follow your orders, but rather the result of a spiritual conversation that took place in the instant of the strike. The target now understands your beliefs and ideals and either believes in them as well or respects your belief enough to be unwilling to oppose you. Regardless of whether or not the target succeeds on their check, you gain a deep understanding of their own beliefs and ideals. While you have this maneuver readied and unexpended, you automatically know the current hit point total of each creature within your melee reach. Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or more of the following ways: For every power point you spend, this strike deals an additional [[1d6]] points of damage. For every [[2d6]] you increase the damage by, you gain a +1 bonus on your ability check. If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this strike, you ignore any immunity to mind-affecting effects the target possesses.</p>"
