You may initiate this counter upon taking damage from an attack or effect originating from an opponent. Make a Swim check against the AC of the creature that damaged you. If successful, they take the same amount of damage they dealt to you. This is a supernatural maneuver. Call of the Deep: If your Swim check succeeds, reduce the damage you receive by half. Your foe still receives the full damage they dealt to you.</p>"
