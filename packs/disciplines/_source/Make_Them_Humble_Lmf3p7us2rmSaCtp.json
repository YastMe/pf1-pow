You can initiate this counter when one of your abilities would be negated by a freedom of movement spell, the slip the bonds power, or effects that replicate either of these effects. Make a dispel check (DC 11 + the effect's caster level or manifester level) against the effect, using your initiator level as your caster level. You gain an additional +1 bonus on your dispel check for every 4 Climb ranks you possess. If you succeed, the effect is dispelled and your ability functions as normal. If the effect originated from an item (such as a ring of freedom of movement) or a non-spell, non-power ability, the effect is instead suppressed for [[1d4]] rounds. If the ability has no caster level, use its originator's Hit Dice.</p>"
