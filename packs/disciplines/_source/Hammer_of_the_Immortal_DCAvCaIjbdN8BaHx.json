Make a melee attack roll and compare it to the AC of each opponent you threaten. If the attack roll hits a target, it deals weapon damage as normal plus an additional [[8d6]] points of damage, and the target takes a -4 penalty to its AC and CMB until the start of your next turn. Use the same damage roll for each target. In addition, you may make a single combat maneuver attempt against each target you hit with this strike as a free action. These combat maneuver attempts do not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>"
