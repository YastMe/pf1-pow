You may initiate this counter after an attack is resolved against you or an ally within close range. You or another ally threatening the attacker (or with the attacker within the first range increment of a ready ranged weapon) may perform an attack action to make a single attack or initiate a strike with an initiation action of 1 standard action against that attacker. Your ally may use your Sun's Gleam ability in place of this attack, using your abilities in place of their own score modifiers if they so wish.  You also heal yourself and allies within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 initiator levels) for a total number of hit points equal to eight times your initiation modifier, divided as you choose between you and your allies.  Essence: Each point of essence invested into this counter increases the total amount of healing done by 10 hit points, and allows another ally within range to perform an attack action or initiate a standard-action strike against the attacker. This healing is split up between targets normally.</p>"
