When you initiate this counter, you gain DR 20/- against the next attack that hits you. If such an attack hits, make a Bluff check opposed by the target's Sense Motive check or their AC, whichever is higher. On a success, the target must attack only you next round. You may initiate this counter in response to an adjacent ally being attacked, causing the attack to automatically hit you instead if you are in reach of the attack (this activates the DR and other effects as normal).</p>"
