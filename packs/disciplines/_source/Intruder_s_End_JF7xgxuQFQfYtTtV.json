With each opportunity, you warp space, teleporting across your domain to attack before returning. After initiating this counter, your threatened area increases to 20 feet for one round. This overlaps with, rather than stacking with, any natural reach you otherwise have; if your natural reach is greater than 20 feet, it is not reduced. In addition, for the duration of this boost, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls while making attacks of opportunity and can make a number of additional attacks of opportunity this round equal to your initiation modifier. This stacks with the Combat Reflexes feat and other effects that increase the number of attacks of opportunity you can make in a round.</p>"
