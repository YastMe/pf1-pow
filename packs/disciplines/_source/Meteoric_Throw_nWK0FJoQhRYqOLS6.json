      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: Three Broken Blade maneuvers<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Melee attack and 25-ft.<br /><strong>Target</strong>: One creature to be thrown at another target creature<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Instant</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The Broken Blade master has transcended the simple use of his own body as a weapon, and has deigned to use his opponent's body as a weapon against those who would stand against him. The initiator makes a grapple attempt and if successful, he may hurl his foe up to 25-ft. as a ranged touch attack at either the ground or another target foe. The thrown enemy suffers [[12d6]] points of damage upon impact, and if thrown at a target creature, that target suffers that damage as well on a failed Reflex saving throw (DC 18 + initiation modifier for half damage). The target of this grapple attempt must be within one size category of the initiator. Large or larger foes being hurled using this method may target the ground beneath multiple targets within the area that creature normally would occupy. (Large creatures, for example, occupy a 10-ft. by 10-ft. space so they would hit all targets within a 10-ft. by 10-ft. area on a failed Reflex save).</p>"
