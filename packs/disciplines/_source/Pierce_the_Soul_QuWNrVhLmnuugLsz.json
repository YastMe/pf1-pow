      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: Three Sleeping Goddess maneuvers<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Melee or ranged attack<br /><strong>Target</strong>: One creature (see text)<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</p><h2>Description</h2><p>You deliver a deadly blow to an enemy with a familiar or similar bond, striking through the mystic ties between master and servant. Make an attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal plus an additional [[7d6]] points of damage. If your target is an animal companion, eidolon, familiar, psicrystal, or similar creature with a telepathic or empathic link to another creature (including creatures within a collective or under the effect of a mindlink power or telepathic bond spell, although not including creatures communicating with the telepathy ability), you can choose to deal this attack's damage to the creature that your target is linked to. The target can make a Will save (DC 17 + your initiation modifier) to negate this transfer of damage; if it succeeds, it takes the strike's damage as normal. The linked creature does not receive a saving throw against this effect. You automatically know whether or not the target is such a creature when this strike hits, although you do not learn the identity of the creature linked to it. If the target is linked to multiple other creatures, then the damage is transferred to one of them at random. This strike can transfer damage across any distance, although it cannot damage a creature on another plane of existence from the target. Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or more of the following ways: For every power point you spend, this strike deals an additional [[1d6]] points of damage. For every [[2d6]] you increase the damage by, the save DC of this strike increases by +1. If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this strike, you deal damage to both the target and the linked creature. The target may still make a Will save to negate the damage being dealt to that creature.</p>"
