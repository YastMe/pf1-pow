When you initiate this boost, mark your current location. At any time during the next round, you may teleport back to the marked space as a free action (even if it isn't your turn). Using this ability ends this boost. If your former space is occupied, you are instead teleported to the nearest unoccupied space. If you use this ability to move out of the reach or range of an attack or effect, the attack or effect is negated. Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or more of the following ways: For every 2 power points you spend, the effect of this boost lasts an additional round. For every 2 power points you spend, you can teleport to the marked space one additional time before ending this boost.</p>"
