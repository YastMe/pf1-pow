Heavenly agents guide their disciple's attack so it may strike true as if it were blessed, even allowing it to strike the unseen. Make an attack against a foe that inflicts an additional [[2d6]] points of sacred damage and the attack is considered good aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. The disciple may also choose to strike incorporeal foes with this strike as if they were made manifest, including fiends who currently possess a creature. To strike a possessing fiend, the body they inhabit must be also struck, but all damage from the attack is inflicted upon the possessing fiend without harming the host.</p>"
