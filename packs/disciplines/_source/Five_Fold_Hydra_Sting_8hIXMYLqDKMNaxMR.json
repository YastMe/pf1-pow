      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: Four Steel Serpent Maneuvers<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Melee attack or ranged attack<br /><strong>Target</strong>: One creature<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A true master of the discipline of Steel Serpent possesses the knowledge how to use his skill, ki, and knowledge of the systems of living creatures, putting them to use for ending of a life. When a disciple initiates this maneuver and strikes a foe, he shows his deadly intent and knowledge in a display of terrible force, striking a foe's heart chakra and sending a cascade of poisonous ki through its body to annihilate the lifeforce of the target. The disciple makes an attack against a foe which if successful the target must make a Fortitude save (DC 19 + initiation modifier). If this save fails, the target is instantly slain as its body's energies revolt and consume it in a flash, reducing the body to ash (equipment is unharmed). If the target succeeds on this save, its body still suffers from the experience as the attack inflicts an additional 50 points of damage. If the target dies from this, its body also dissolves into ash. Victims slain by this attack cannot be resurrected normally; a wish or miracle spell must be cast first to restore the life-force of the victim's spirit before any raise attempt can be attempted. This is a supernatural ability.</p>"
