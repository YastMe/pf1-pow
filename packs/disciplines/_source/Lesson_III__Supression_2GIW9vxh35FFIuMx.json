You never let up, and your constant assault can unbalance even the most experienced warriors. While you maintain this stance, the target of your first attack on each turn becomes flat-footed against that attack. In addition, you can make a lock attempt against an adjacent creature once per round as a free action. You may also make a lock attempt against any adjacent creature you hit with an attack of opportunity. If you interrupt a creature's movement with a successful lock, they still spend their action.</p>"
