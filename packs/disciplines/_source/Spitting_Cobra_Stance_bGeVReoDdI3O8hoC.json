When at range, thrown weapons inflict an additional [[2d6]] points of damage and throwing them does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Use of poison (mundane or magical poisons such as stings or prana maneuvers) are more vicious as well, adding +1 to each damage die or ability damage die rolled for its effect (effects with a flat number of damage increase this by +1).</p>"
