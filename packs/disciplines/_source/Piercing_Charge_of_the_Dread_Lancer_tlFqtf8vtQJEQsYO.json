When you initiate this maneuver, you make a charge attack, moving up to twice your speed in a straight line as normal. Unlike a normal charge attack, you do not designate an opponent, and do not need to end your movement within reach of an opponent. In addition, your movement ignores difficult terrain and intervening creatures, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Rather than making an attack at the end of your charge, your strike targets every opponent who was caught in your path; treat your movement as a line-shaped effect for determining who is affected. Each opponent caught within the line takes damage as if you had hit them with an attack with a weapon you are wielding (including damage from magical properties or other bonuses), and must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 19 + your initiation modifier) or take an additional [[15d6]] points of damage. A successful save halves the additional damage, but does not negate the damage from your attack. Use the same damage roll for each creature. Ths strike can only be initiated with a discipline weapon.</p>"
