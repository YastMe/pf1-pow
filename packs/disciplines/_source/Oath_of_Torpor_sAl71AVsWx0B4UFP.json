After initiating this boost, each successful attack or combat maneuver attempt you make against an opponent before the start of your next turn also causes that opponent to become cursed for one minute. Each time a creature cursed by this boost moves, it must succeed at a Will save (DC 14 + your initiation modifier) or become slowed (as the spell) until the end of its next turn. A successful save against this effect ends the curse. Alternatively, if a creature cursed by this boost does not willingly move from its space for two consecutive rounds, the curse ends without a need for a saving throw. A creature forced to move (such as by a bull rush) does not trigger this effect.</p>"
