Whenever an ally within close range would die or be destroyed, you may initiate this maneuver, even if it is not your turn. That ally's hit points becomes 1. Then, you may make a melee or ranged attack against an enemy. If it hits, it deals an additional [[3d6]] points of damage and you also heal the ally subject to this maneuver by an amount equal to the damage dealt by this attack. A creature may only benefit from this maneuver once, and must experience sunrise (or wait 24 hours, whichever comes first) before they can gain its benefit again. Essence: The ally is also healed for 7 hit points per point of essence invested into this maneuver after the attack is made.</p>"
