      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: None<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Melee or ranged attack<br /><strong>Target</strong>: One creature<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</p><h2>Description</h2><p>You steal precious air from your foe's lungs. Make an attack. If it hits, it deals an additional [[1d6]] damage. Additionally, your foe must make a Fortitude save (DC 12 + initiation modifier) or they lose and you gain a number of rounds of air equal to your initiation modifier. Stealing air has no effect on water-breathing creatures underwater, nor air-breathing creatures above water. This is a supernatural maneuver. Call of the Deep: Instead of stealing rounds of air, you may temporarily steal a water-breathing creature's ability to breathe underwater. They immediately gain a number of rounds of air equal to twice their Constitution modifier. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier. If they run out of air, they begin to drown. If you hit a creature under this effect with this strike again, you may steal these rounds of air as normal. If you have the ability to use call of the deep effects above water, you may use this to prevent an air-breathing creature from breathing, potentially causing them to suffocate.</p>"
