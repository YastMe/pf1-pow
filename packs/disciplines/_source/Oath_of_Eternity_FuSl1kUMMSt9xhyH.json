You teleport across the battlefield with each blow, blinking towards an enemy then returning to your original position. After initiating this counter, your threatened area increases to 40 feet for one round. This overlaps with, rather than stacking with, any natural reach you otherwise have; if your natural reach is greater than 40 feet, it is not reduced. In addition, for the duration of this boost, your attacks of opportunity deal an additional [[3d6]] points of damage and curse the target for one round, and you can make a number of additional attacks of opportunity this round equal to 1/2 your initiator level. This stacks with the Combat Reflexes feat and other effects that increase the number of attacks of opportunity you can make in a round.</p>"
