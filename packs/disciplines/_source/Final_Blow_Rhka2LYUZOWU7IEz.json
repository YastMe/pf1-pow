By showing his enemy a merciful, swift death in battle, the disciple may continue to his next victory while letting both keep their honor. The disciple makes a melee attack against an injured foe, and if the attack is successful and the foe is under 25% of his maximum hit points, the attack is treated as a coup de grace that is performed as part of that attack action instead of the full round action usually required. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The attack does damage as a critical hit, and the foe must make a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 10 + the damage inflicted or die. If the foe is above 25% of his maximum hit points, then this maneuver has no effect and normal damage is rolled. Disciples with this maneuver readied have a keen sense of their enemy's condition, and may make a Sense Motive check as a free action (DC 20) to gauge if their opponent is eligible to be finished by this maneuver.</p>"
