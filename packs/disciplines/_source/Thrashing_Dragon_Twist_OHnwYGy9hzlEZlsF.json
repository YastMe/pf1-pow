The initiator attacks surrounding foes while fighting with two weapons, making an attack roll with both wielded weapons against each target at full base attack bonus (effectively making two attacks on each target, one with each weapon) against each enemy that he threatens. If the initiator is capable of making an unarmed strike or natural attack (through Improved Unarmed Strike feat or natural weapons) then the initiator may add an additional attack per target using his unarmed or one chosen natural attack, also at full base attack bonus.</p>"
