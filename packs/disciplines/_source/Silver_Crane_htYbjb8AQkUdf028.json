      "value": "<p>Disciples of the Silver Crane are men and women for whom the power of the celestial and divine flow into the arts of their blade. The Silver Crane is a goodly discipline that is inspired by the teachings of good aligned outsiders. It focuses on strong strikes designed to combat evil, celestial insights, and combat-predictions to defeat foes and enable the initiator and his allies to endure the hardships of battle against the forces of evil. Upon learning the art of Silver Crane, the disciple becomes in tune with the flows of the celestial realm, gaining heavenly insights into combat as if the angels themselves were granting insight to the warrior in battle.</p><p>A character may also choose to strike incorporeal foes with strikes made from this discipline as if they were made manifest, including fiends and other entities who currently possess a creature. To strike a possessing creature, the body they inhabit must be also struck, but all damage from the attack is inflicted upon the possessing fiend without harming the host.</p><p><strong>Associated Skills</strong>: Perception</p><p><strong>Associated Weapon Groups</strong>: Bows, hammers, and spears</p><p><strong>Special Note</strong>: The discipline of Silver Crane is to be considered a supernatural discipline and all abilities within are considered supernatural abilities and follow the rules and restrictions of such. All abilities in this discipline carry the [Good] descriptor.</p><p><strong>Sacred Damage</strong>: Sacred damage comes from attacks that are heavily infused with the power of sheer Good and carry this holy power over as a form of harmful energy to evil-aligned beings. Sacred damage deals full damage to incorporeal targets, and deals damage as if the weapon were good-aligned. As it is not a weapon damage type, it automatically bypasses all damage reduction. </p>",
