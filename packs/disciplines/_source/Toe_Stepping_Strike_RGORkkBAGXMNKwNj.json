Make a melee attack. If successful, you deal damage as normal and the target is tricked for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier. Additionally, they are flat-footed against the next attack you make against them until the end of your next turn. Exploit: The target is flat-footed against all attacks made against them until the end of your next turn.</p>"
