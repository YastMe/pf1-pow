With a sudden twist and jump through the opponent's defenses, the disciple strikes hard into the exposed and undefended foe. The initiator must move at least 10-ft. through two spaces that his opponent threatens and make a Acrobatics check equal to the target's CMD (this roll counts as both a check to use the maneuver as well as to negate potential attacks of opportunity from moving through a threatened area). If successful, make an attack against the target's flat-footed Armor Class, and the attack inflicts an additional [[6d6]] points of damage.</p>"
