      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: None<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Melee or ranged attack<br /><strong>Target</strong>: One creature<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous (see text)</p><h2>Description</h2><p>You and your allies harry a foe, weakening its resolve and leaving it open to mental intrusion. Make an attack. If it hits, it deals an additional [[1d6]] points of damage, and the target must succeed at a Will save (DC 12 + your initiation modifier) or you become able to read their surface thoughts, as if by the read thoughts power, for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier. You do not need to concentrate on this ability to maintain it. Each time one of your allies successfully hits that creature while it is under the effect of this strike, the duration increases by one round, up to a maximum number of rounds equal to your initiator level. Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or more of the following ways: For every power point you spend, this strike deals an additional [[1d6]] points of damage. For every [[2d6]] you increase the damage by, the save DC of this strike increases by +1. If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this strike, you may make a melee touch attack against the target rather than a normal attack. If it hits, it deals no damage, but you still can read their surface thoughts on a failed save. If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this strike, your target does not get a saving throw against it.</p>"
