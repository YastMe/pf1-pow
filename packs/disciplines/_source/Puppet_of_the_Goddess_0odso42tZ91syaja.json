Make an attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal plus an additional [[4d6]] points of damage, and the target must succeed at a Will save (DC 14 + your initiation modifier) or have one of its senses completely overridden for one round, as if you had manifested the false sensory input power on them. You do not need to concentrate on this ability to maintain it, although you cannot switch the sense you are falsifying with this strike. Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or more of the following ways: For every power point you spend, this strike deals an additional [[1d6]] points of damage. For every [[2d6]] you increase the damage by, the save DC of this strike increases by +1. For every 3 power points you spend, the effect of this strike lasts an additional round. If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this strike, you ignore any immunity to mind-affecting effects the target possesses. Instead, a normally-immune target gains a +5 resistance bonus on its saving throw.</p>"
