When you initiate this strike, you create a 30-foot line of energy that deals [[5d6]] points of damage of your active element's associated energy type to each creature within its area. This strike also has one of the following effects, based on your active element: Air The crack of thunder accompanying the lightning deafens creatures for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier. Earth The acid spray also creates a greasy, oily slick, causing creatures who fail their Reflex saves to drop items they are holding as if affected by the grease spell. Fire The intensity of the flaming blast adds an additional +1 point of damage per die and dazzles each target for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier. Water The icy blast makes surfaces very slippery, and creatures who fail their Reflex saves slip on the ice and fall prone. Creatures caught in the line can make a Reflex save (DC 13 + your initiation modifier) to take half damage and negate the added effect. Animus augmentation: You may spend up to fire points of animus to increase the damage of this strike by [[2d6]] per point of animus spent and increase the save DC of this strike by +1 per point of animus spent. Th number of points of animus you may spend augmenting this maneuver is not limited by your level; you may always spend up to fie points, although the total damage dice for this maneuver may not exceed your initiator level (up to a maximum of [[15d6]]). For example, a 7th-level initiator could spend fie points of animus augmenting this maneuver, adding a +5 bonus to his save DC, but he would still only deal [[7d6]] points of damage.</p>"
