(see text)<br /><strong>Target</strong>: You or one ally (see text)<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The most basic tenet of the Sleeping Goddess discipline is that a strong enough belief, channeled through the lens of psionic power, can do anything. With this technique, you momentarily enter a state of denial, asserting through your power that you are not and will not be harmed. You can initiate this counter when you take damage from a melee or ranged attack. Make an Autohypnosis check, using your opponent's attack roll as the DC. If you succeed, you take only half damage from the attack, although any other effects of the attack are resolved normally. Augment: You can augment this maneuver in one or more of the following ways: For every power point you spend, you gain a +1 bonus on your Autohypnosis check. If you spend 3 power points, you take no damage from the attack on a successful Autohypnosis check, rather than half. If you spend 5 power points, you are completely unaffected by the attack on a successful Autohypnosis check, taking no damage and ignoring any additional effects of the attack. If you expend your psionic focus while initiating this counter, you can use it in response to an attack damaging an ally within 60 feet. Make an Autohypnosis check as normal, then apply the effects of this counter to that ally rather than yourself.</p>"
