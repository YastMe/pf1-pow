      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: None<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Personal<br /><strong>Target</strong>: You<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Stance</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Though heavy conditioning and strength training, you have become adept at using a shield in tandem with a polearm to great effect. While maintain this stance, you can wield a normally two-handed discipline weapon as a one-handed weapon (or a normally one-handed discipline weapon as a light weapon) when using a shield in your off hand. When fighting in this manner, your attacks with discipline weapons and shield bashes deal an additional [[1d6]] points of damage (+[[1d6]] per ten initiator levels). In addition, adjacent allies (up to a maximum number equal to your initiation modifier) wearing shields may interlock their shields with yours as a free action on their turn. Each shield-bearing character improves their shield bonus to AC by +1 for each ally in this position (up to a maximum of +5). Allies linking shields with you in this manner do not need to be in this stance unless they wish to increase the number of allies within the phalanx as well. Special Note: If you possess the armament shield class feature (see zweihander sentinel warder archetype in Path of War), its benefits are suspended while you maintain this stance. You must be wielding an actual shield to interlock it with the shields of allies.</p>"
