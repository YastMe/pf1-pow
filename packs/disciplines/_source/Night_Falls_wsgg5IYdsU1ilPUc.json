Make a lock attempt against a creature you are already locking. If you succeed, that creature becomes pinned and silenced for as long as they are locked. They can attempt to escape the lock as a move action, as normal, even though they cannot actually move (they take no penalty on their checks for being pinned). If you successfully pin a flat-footed creature in the same turn that you locked them, they cannot make a sound in response (potentially allowing you to take them down silently).</p>"
