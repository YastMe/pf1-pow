The initiator makes an additional unarmed strike against a target as part of his full attack action at his full attack bonus but suffers a -2 penalty. If this attack hits then it inflicts an additional [[2d6]] points of damage. The character does not provoke attacks of opportunity for not possessing the Improved Unarmed Strike feat when using this strike, but damage is only considered lethal if the character does possess that feat or weapon that would be worn on one's foot.</p>"
