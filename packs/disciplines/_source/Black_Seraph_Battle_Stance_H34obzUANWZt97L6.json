Some who have witnessed a disciple of Black Seraph using this stance have seen plants wither and turn to ash around them and hazy, smoky wings appear around the disciple. Others have seen hellfire licking over their bodies. Regardless, while in this stance, any weapon that the martial disciple wields is treated as if it had the unholy special weapon property. Additionally, he is considered under the influence of a protection from good spell with a caster level equal to his initiator level. </p>"
