The initiator makes a CMB check with a +4 competence bonus that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and if successful the initiator rolls into a reverse somersault to hurl his foe up to 20-ft. away from him (the disciple's player chooses the flight path of the thrown foe) where they land in heavily, taking [[6d6]] points of damage.</p>"
