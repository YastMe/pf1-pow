Make an attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal, and you can heal yourself and allies within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 initiator levels) for a total number of hit points equal to twice your initiation modifier, divided as you choose between you and your allies. Alternatively, you may choose to grant a single ally within close range a saving throw against an ongoing effect on them that offers multiple saving throws over time to negate, or has its duration measured in rounds at the effect's original DC, at the effect's original DC. If it succeeds, the effect ends. This does not progress poison, diseases, or similar effects on a failed saving throw. Essence: Each point of essence invested into this strike increases the total amount of healing done by 4 hit points. This healing is split up between targets normally.  </p>"
