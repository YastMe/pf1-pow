As long as his allies within 30-ft. of him can clearly hear his shouts and understand his language, he grants his allies the ability to gain flanking with all adjacent allies that are fighting in melee against the same opponent (i.e. if two allies of the initiator are 20-ft. away fighting a target together, and the initiator has another ally assisting him in combat against a different target, both pairs gain flanking bonuses against their foes even if they are not normally in flanking position).</p>"
