While you maintain this stance, you gain a +4 dodge bonus to your AC and your weapon's reach increases by 5 feet. In addition, any creature you threaten that leaves their square provokes an attack of opportunity from you, even if their movement was a 5-foot step or movement that would not otherwise provoke attacks of opportunity (such as with the Spring Attack feat or a teleportation effect). Your opponents cannot use the Withdraw action to treat the squares they start in as no longer threatened by you.</p>"
