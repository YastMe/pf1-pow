You can use this boost when you hit a creature with an attack to cause that creature to be struck by your attack again at the start of your next turn. They take half the damage they took from the initial attack (including any bonus damage), and are also affected by any additional effects, such a save against a condition, a delivered touch spell, or the effects of a maneuver or stance. This boost's effect is not replicated on the second hit of the attack.</p>"
