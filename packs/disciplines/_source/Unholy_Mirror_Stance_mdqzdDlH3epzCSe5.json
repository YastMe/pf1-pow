While you maintain this stance, you can choose to have any power, psi-like ability, spell, and/or spell-like ability that targets an opponent within 30 feet also affect a number of secondary targets equal to your initiation modifier. Each secondary target must be within 30 feet of you, and none can be affected more than once. If the original effect requires an attack roll, use the same roll for each target. If the effect deals damage, secondary targets take half as much damage as the primary target, and if it does not deal damage, its save DC is reduced by 4 instead.</p>"
