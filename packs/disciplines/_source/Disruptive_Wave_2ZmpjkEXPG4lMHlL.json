You can initiate this counter in response to being targeted by a power, psi-like ability, spell, or spell-like ability. Make a charge attack against the originator of the effect, moving up to twice your speed towards them as normal. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal, possibly interrupting the effect and increasing the DC of the Concentration check to not lose the effect by +4.</p>"
