In the midst of battle ghostly images of wings or blazing wrathful haloes can often be seen near Silver Crane disciples. While in this stance, any weapon that the martial disciple wields is treated as if it had the holy special weapon property. Additionally, the character is considered under the influence of a protection from evil spell with a caster level equal to his initiator level.</p>"
