You, that's who. Make an attack. If it hits, it deals damage as normal plus an additional [[5d6]] damage. Additionally, you may make an Escape Artist check against the target's CMD. If successful, they are tricked for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier and this strike gains an extra effect of your choice. The foe is blinded for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier. The foe is deafened for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier. Exploit: The blinded or deafened condition is permanent, and must be healed with magic that would cure such ailments or a Heal check with a DC equal to 15 + your initiator level. This Heal check takes 10 minutes to complete.</p>"
