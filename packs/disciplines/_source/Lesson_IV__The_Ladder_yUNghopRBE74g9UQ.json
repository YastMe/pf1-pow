      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: Two Fool's Errand maneuvers<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Personal<br /><strong>Target</strong>: You<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Stance</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Your first lesson was how to fall; your fourth lesson is how to not. Your intense training has given you the ability to climb the very air, grasping the world with your hands and kicking of with your feet. While you maintain this stance, you become immune to falling damage and gain a special mode of movement. By spending a move action, you gain the ability to make a number of leaps through the air this turn equal to 1/2 your ranks in the Climb skill. Making a leap is a free action, and each leap moves you up to 10 feet in any direction (unlike with a fly speed, you neither gain nor lose distance for moving vertically in this way). You need not jump of of a physical object; you can leap of the air through sheer power and skill. If you end your turn with leaps remaining, these leaps are expended, and you remain hovering in the air until your next turn (at which point you fall unless you must spend another move action to gain leaps). Otherwise, you fall. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. If you initiate a maneuver or use an ability that would allow you to move a distance equal to or greater than your land speed (such as windmill waltz flurry or a strike that includes a charge attack), you may gain leaps as if you had spent a move action rather than making that movement. You still gain any other benefits or penalties from the ability in question (such as a charge attack's bonus on attack rolls and penalty to AC).</p>"
