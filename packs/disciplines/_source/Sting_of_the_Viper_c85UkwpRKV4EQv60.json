The disciple makes an attack against a target which if successful inflicts an additional [[8d6]] points of damage and [[1d6]] points of Charisma damage (Fortitude save DC equal to 16 + initiation modifier to halve this Charisma damage). After a failed save, for the following two rounds, the corrupted ki energies inflict an additional [[2d6]] points of damage and 2 additional points of Charisma damage. This is a supernatural ability.</p>"
