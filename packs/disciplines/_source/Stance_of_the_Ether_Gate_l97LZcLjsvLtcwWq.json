While the disciple is in this stance, he may teleport up to his movement speed as a move action, or twice his movement speed as a full round action, at will. He must see his destination clearly to be able to teleport to it. The initiator may not take any creatures with him when teleporting; only himself and the gear he is carrying plus up to an additional 20 lbs. This stance meets the qualifications for the Dimensional Agility feats, should the initiator wish to take them.</p>"
