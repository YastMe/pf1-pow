Every enemy in range must make a Fortitude save (DC 16 + initiation modifier) or become nauseated for as long as they stay in the cloud. A successful save means they are sickened instead of nauseated. A creature that leaves and re-enters must save again. The cloud also lowers the light level in its radius by 1. The cloud can be dispersed by anything that would disperse a fog cloud. This is a supernatural maneuver. Call of the Deep: On a failed save the creatures also take [[5d6]] damage the first round they spend inside the cloud and [[2d6]] each additional round. A creature can only take the [[5d6]] damage once per initiation of this maneuver.</p>"
