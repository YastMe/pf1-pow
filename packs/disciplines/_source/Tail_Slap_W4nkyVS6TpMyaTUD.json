As part of this strike, the initiator makes a normal melee attack and if successful, the disciple makes an additional powerful spinning kick, landing a heavy blow to his foe which may temporarily rob it of its senses. The initiator makes an attack against a foe at full base attack bonus. If successful, the attack inflicts additional damage equal his unarmed strike damage plus an additional [[6d6]] points of damage and potentially stuns his foe. On a failed Fortitude saving throw (DC 16 + initiation modifier) the foe is stunned for [[1d4]] rounds. If the saving throw is successful, the foe is merely dazed for one round. The character does not provoke attacks of opportunity for not possessing the Improved Unarmed Strike feat when using this strike, but additional damage from this strike inflicts non-lethal damage unless the character possesses that feat.</p>"
