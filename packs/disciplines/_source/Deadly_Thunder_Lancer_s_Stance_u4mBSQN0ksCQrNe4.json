While you maintain this stance, you add your initiation modifier to attack rolls, damage rolls, and Acrobatics checks to jump or tumble. In addition, you gain the benefits of the Spring Attack feat, even if you do not meet its prerequisites. When you use this feat, you can initiate a strike with an initiation action of one standard action or less instead of making a normal attack during your movement. If that strike includes a charge, you gain the normal benefits and penalties of the charge combat maneuver, although your movement is not limited to a straight line, you may move through difficult terrain or other obstacles as if you were not charging, and you do not have to end your movement after initiating your strike.</p>"
