The initiator makes a melee touch attack against a target, and may teleport to another target no more than 20-ft. from the first (and do the same for a third target) making another melee touch attack on each subsequent target and inflicting [[10d6]] points of force damage to all affected. On a failed attack or after the final target, the disciple appears up to 15-ft. from the final target to finish his turn. The touch attacks themselves cannot be unarmed strikes or weapon strikes that inflict damage normally; the disciple must lay their hand against the target in a non-damaging way to initiate this maneuver (even if wielding a weapon in that hand, this can be used by simply touching the target with a fist or back of the hand).</p>"
