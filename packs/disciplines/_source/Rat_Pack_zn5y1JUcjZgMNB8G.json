You may treat all allies within 30 feet as having one teamwork feat you possess. If your allies are maintaining a Roaring Mouse stance, they actually gain the teamwork feat while you are maintaining this stance, allowing them to use it themself. You may, as a swift action, change the feat this stance is granting.</p>"
