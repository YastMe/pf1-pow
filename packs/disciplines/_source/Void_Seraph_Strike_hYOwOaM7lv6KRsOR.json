The initiator must make a ranged touch attack against a target creature, and if successful the target is ripped and slashed by the claws and wings of shadowy birds of venomous hate, taking [[6d6]] points of profane damage per round for [[1d4]] rounds. While being devoured by these shadowy birds, the target suffers a 50% miss chance on any attacks he makes due to his senses being obscured by the flapping wings and horrible pain he is enduring.</p>"
