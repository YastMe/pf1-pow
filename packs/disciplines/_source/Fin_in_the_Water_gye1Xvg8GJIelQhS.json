When initiating this boost you may move up to twice your speed and make a Swim check. Treat this Swim check as a demoralize attempt against every enemy creature in range. If successful, the creatures are panicked instead of shaken. Call of the Deep: The concealment of the water aids you in inflicting absolute horror upon those you intend to hunt and kill. While in the water your targets are frozen in terror and gain the cowering condition instead of panicked.</p>"
