While in this stance, the disciple may make grapple attempts without provoking attacks of opportunity, and if the disciple successfully grapples a foe, he may constrict his opponent to inflict [[4d6]] + his Strength modifier in damage. The manner in which he must carry himself in this stance, muscles taught and stiffened, grants him some degree of protection, adding a +4 bonus to his natural armor.</p>"
