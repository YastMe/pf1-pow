As part of initiating this strike, you may move up to your land speed as if you had a fly speed with average maneuverability, then make a melee attack against a creature within your reach at the end of this movement. This attack deals weapon damage as normal. If your movement ends in a location that cannot support you, your attack occurs before you fall (you take falling damage as normal). If you have a means to fly, glide, or hover after your movement, you may do so. You can make Climb checks in place of Fly checks during the movement of this strike.</p>"
