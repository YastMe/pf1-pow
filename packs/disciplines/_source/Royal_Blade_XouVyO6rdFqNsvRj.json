By initiating this maneuver, his show of majestic force proves his claim to power. The disciple may add a +5 insight bonus to his attack roll and +[[5d8]] insight bonus to his damage roll on a single melee attack made during this turn. Additionally targets who've been struck by an attack augmented with this boost must make a Will save (DC 17 + initiation modifier) or be left cowering for 1 round.</p>"
