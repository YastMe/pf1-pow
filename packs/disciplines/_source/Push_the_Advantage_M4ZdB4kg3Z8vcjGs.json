You may initiate this counter when you or an ally defeats an enemy. That ally may immediately take a standard action, and you may also heal yourself and allies within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 initiator levels) for a total number of hit points equal to seven times your initiation modifier, divided as you choose between you and your allies. Essence: Each point of essence invested into this counter increases the total amount of healing done by 9 hit points, and while essence is invested into this counter, the target gains the option to move up to 5 feet per point of essence invested after this maneuver is initiated, provoking attacks of opportunity as normal. This healing is split up between targets normally</p>"
