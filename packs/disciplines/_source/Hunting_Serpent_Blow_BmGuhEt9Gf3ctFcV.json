The disciple makes a Heal check with a difficulty equal to his opponent's armor class. If this check is successful, then the target is made flat-footed and the disciple may make a melee attack against him, inflicting an additional [[1d6]] points of damage if successful. If this Heal check fails, then his opponent sees through this ruse, and the disciple makes his melee attack with a -2 penalty as the enemy is anticipating his attack.</p>"
