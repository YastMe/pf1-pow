Make a melee attack. If successful, you deal damage as normal and the target is tricked for a number of rounds equal to your initiation modifier. Additionally, make an Escape Artist check with a DC equal to the target's CMD. If successful, you may move up to your speed (even if you've already moved this round) and the target is dazed for one round. Your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Exploit: The target is stunned instead of dazed. Upon using this exploit, the target is immune to this exploit for three rounds.</p>"
