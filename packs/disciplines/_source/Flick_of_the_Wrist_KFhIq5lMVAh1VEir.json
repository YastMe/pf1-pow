The initiator makes two rapid attack rolls at his full base attack bonus against the target's AC with a +2 bonus. If both attacks are successful, the target is disarmed of his primary weapon (no roll needed). Resolve damage from the two attacks made as part of this strike as normal. If the target is using natural attacks or the target has a locked gauntlet, then this maneuver is ineffective for disarming a foe.</p>"
