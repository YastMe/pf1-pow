The initiator creates a 30 foot line that deals [[6d6]] + initiator level (max +20) damage to all foes within the area of effect. Foes within the area may make a Reflex save (DC 15 + initiation modifier) for half damage. Those who fail their save are also knocked off-balance. Call of the Deep: When a creature fails its save against this maneuver, they are also pushed to the end of the line. Each creature that fails takes an additional [[1d6]] damage for every creature that failed before them (starting at the creature closest to the initiator) as they slam into one another while being pushed back.</p>"
