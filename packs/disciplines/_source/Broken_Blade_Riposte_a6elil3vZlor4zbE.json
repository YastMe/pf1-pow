This ebb and flow that the disciple has mastered allows him to focus his pain into a forceful counter blow to drive his opponent back. After being struck in melee combat, the initiator may make an immediate counter attack at his full base attack bonus and this attack inflicts an additional [[3d6]] points of damage and pushes the target away from the initiator 5-ft.; this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>"
