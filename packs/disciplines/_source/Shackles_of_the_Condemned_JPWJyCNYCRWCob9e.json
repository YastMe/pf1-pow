      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: Two Eternal Guardian maneuvers<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Melee attack<br /><strong>Target</strong>: One creature<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous (see text)</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Your strike binds your target, summoning cursed manacles that bind both you and your enemy to a single fate. Make a melee attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal plus an additional [[5d6]] points of damage, and the target becomes cursed and entangled for a number of rounds equal to your initiator level. While under the effect of this maneuver, the target cannot move further than 30 feet away from you, even by teleportation effects. You or your target can pull on the chain as a trip or drag attempt as an attack action without provoking attacks of opportunity. You gain a +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to your CMD when making these attempts or having them made against you. If the target begins and ends its turn adjacent to you, it can make a Will save (DC 15 + your initiation modifier) to end the effects of this strike. If you move further than 30 feet away from the target, the curse is broken and the effects of this strike end. You can end the effects of this strike as a free action, and it ends automatically if you are knocked unconscious or killed.</p>"
