Make an attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal, and the target becomes cursed, taking a -2 penalty on damage rolls with weapon attacks for as long as it is cursed. If an affected target does not make an attack during its turn, it can make a Will save (DC 12 + your initiation modifier) to end this effect. If the target prostrates itself (treated as dropping prone) and grovels for a full round, the curse is automatically removed.</p>"
