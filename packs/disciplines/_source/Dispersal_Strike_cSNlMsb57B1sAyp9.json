The initiator makes an attack on a target creature and if successful, the strike inflicts [[12d6]] points of force damage in place of normal damage, and the target gains the incorporeal subtype for [[1d4]] rounds (see Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 1 for further details). The target must make a Will save (DC 17 + initiation modifier) to negate the incorporeality portion of this strike or only his body becomes incorporeal and items held in his hands do not, falling to the ground at their feet. This strike does not function on targets who already possess the incorporeal subtype. This is an Ethereal plane using maneuver.</p>"
