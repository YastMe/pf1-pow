(see text)<br /><strong>Target</strong>: One creature (see text)<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous (see text)</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The disciple barrels through the enemy lines, terrifying his foes. Make a charge attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal plus an additional [[6d6]] points of damage, and all opponents (including the target) within 30 feet must succeed at a Will save (DC 16 + your initiation modifier) or become frightened for [[1d4]] rounds and shaken for one minute after. Creatures with more hit dice than your initiator level cannot become frightened by this strike, although they still become shaken on a failed save. Any creature that starts its turn without line of sight to you can make another saving throw to end this effect.</p>"
