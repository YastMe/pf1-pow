The initiator makes an attack against a foe and if successful, inflicts damage as normal to the target and inflicts the broken condition on a target piece or suit armor or shield and imposes a -4 penalty to their armor or shield bonus (not to exceed the total armor or shield bonus) until the item is repaired. If the item is magical, this maneuver is resolved as a normal sunder attempt as a free action as part of the strike (which does not provoke attacks of opportunity) and the initiator gains a +2 bonus to his CMB check for this attempt.</p>"
