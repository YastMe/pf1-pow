      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: Two Veiled Moon maneuvers<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Melee attack<br /><strong>Target</strong>: One creature<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: [[1d4]] rounds</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The Veiled Moon teaches that its disciples must know how to balance the scales between both worlds, so to make a foe real in the Material world, then the disciple must briefly sojourn to the other side. The disciple makes a melee attack against an incorporeal target, and if successful the target loses their incorporeal subtype for [[1d4]] rounds and takes [[12d6]] points of force damage (incorporeal foes lose their Charisma bonus to AC and have a Strength score equal to their Charisma score -4; all incorporeal equipment temporarily becomes corporeal with the target). The disciple gains the incorporeal subtype for a like number of rounds (losing his Strength score and gaining a +4 bonus to Charisma and he may apply his Charisma bonus to his AC as a deflection bonus; all of his equipment becomes temporarily incorporeal with him as well). This is an Ethereal plane using maneuver.</p>"
