By initiating this counter, the disciple learns to use his foe's attacks to blind it against him then take advantage of this impairment. The initiator makes an opposed attack roll against his foe's attack roll, and if successful the attacker misses the initiator who then gains total concealment from his foe [[1d4]] rounds. This is a supernatural ability.</p>"
