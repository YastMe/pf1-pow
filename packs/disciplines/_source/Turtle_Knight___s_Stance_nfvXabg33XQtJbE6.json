While in this stance, the initiator may not move from his spot, but gains several benefits for doing so. He gains a circumstance bonus equal to his initiator level to CMD, he gains the improved uncanny dodge special ability (with a rogue level equal to his initiator level), and his shield bonus to AC improves by +4. Voluntarily moving beyond a 5-ft. step per round ends this stance automatically, but should he be moved not of his own violation, he retains the stance.</p>"
