      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: One Veiled Moon maneuver<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Personal<br /><strong>Target</strong>: You<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Position is relative to the Veiled Moon disciple's thinking, and his position in the universe is mutable. Using these principles, the disciple may circumvent reality to remove himself from harms way when necessary. The initiator makes a Stealth check opposing the attacker's Perception check. If successful then the initiator may teleport to any spot within 10- ft. away from his current position and leave a minor image duplicate of himself behind to take the attack of his foe in his place. Minor images created by this counter last for [[1d4]] rounds or until dispersed. This ability may be used to defend against spells and effects that directly target the initiator with an attack roll (such as ranged touch effects) or for those that allow for a Reflex save. If the attack would still encompass an area to where the initiator is teleporting (such as with the fireball spell he has not vacated), the initiator would still be struck by the attack.</p>"
