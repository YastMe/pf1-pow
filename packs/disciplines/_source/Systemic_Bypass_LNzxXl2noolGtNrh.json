While this boost is active, you cannot be perceived with any sort of divination effect, clairsentience effect, or any piece of equipment with modifies senses (such as tremor boots, veemods, or even truesight goggles). In addition, any attacks you make or maneuvers you perform resolve as if the target is being affected by Antimagic Field, Antitech Field, and Null Psionics Field. This does not affect the maneuver or other abilities that you are using to affect the target, but nullifies any defensive abilities they may possess.</p>"
