Make a 90-foot trail ranged attack. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal plus an additional [[1d6]] points of damage, and the creature hit is affected as if they entered the trail. Enemies entering the trail are marked with a sigil, becoming cursed as long as they are marked. Whenever a marked enemy makes an attack roll, saving throw, or concentration check, they may choose to activate the sigil to suffer a -4 penalty to their roll, and remove the sigil. Activating this sigil deos not require an action. If a sigil-marked creature's turn ends and they still carry the sigil, they must make a Will save (DC 12 + your initiation modifier), activating the sigil with the -4 penalty to this save; if they fail, they are dazed until the end of their next turn. A creature automatically passes this save if they did not take a standard or full-round action on their turn.</p>"
