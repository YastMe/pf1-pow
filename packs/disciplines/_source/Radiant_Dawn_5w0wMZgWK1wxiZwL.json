      "value": "<p>Brought forth by the desire to rule, and shaped on the battlefield through ages of conflict, Radiant Dawn is a discipline that is steeped in blood and akasha. In ages where conflict and war are common, those with this discipline watch over the battlefield like the sun in the sky, directing allies to seize victory, while hindering enemy’s powerful abilities to shift the tide of battle into their favor. In ages where conflict has been distant, Radiant Dawn has existed as an akashic meditative exercise amongst rulers and nobility. Regardless of what form it takes, practitioners of the Radiant Dawn strive to be like the sun itself: Above all.</p><p>Knowledge of Radiant Dawn maneuvers grants essence equal to the number of maneuvers and stances known, to a maximum of the highest level Radiant Dawn or maneuver stance they know. Maneuvers from the Radiant Dawn discipline are imbued and enhanced with akashic energies; as such, they are supernatural abilities.</p><p><strong>Associated Skill</strong>: Diplomacy</p><p><strong>Associated Weapon Groups</strong>: Bows, flails, hammers, polearms, and the Sun’s Gleam ability.</p><p><strong>Access to the Discipline</strong>: Akasha is a somewhat simplistic form of magic, generated by mixing life energy, called essence, with the small amounts of raw magic that suffuse all things and shaping them into rough physical forms. Radiant Dawn disciples follows much the same path as akashic veilweaver; but where veilweavers imbue their life energy with raw magic to give them physical form, Radiant Dawn replaces that arcane power with martial forms and prowess. Once the basics are learned, essence can easily be shifted around within the body for each form and attack with ease. As such, any character of any class can access the Radiant Dawn discipline by trading one of their available disciplines for it. If they do, they gain Diplomacy as a class skill.</p><p><strong>Special Note</strong>: Maneuvers from this discipline are imbued and enhanced with akashic energies. As such, they are supernatural abilities. Radiant Dawn maneuvers become essence receptacles as the initiator readies them, allowing them to invest essence much like in a veil or akashic feat. Essence invested into a maneuver is temporarily bound when that maneuver is expended, and cannot be recovered or reassigned to another receptacle until that maneuver is recovered.   </p>",
