Make an Escape Artist check against a target's CMD. If successful, you suppress all damage reduction, energy resistance, and energy immunity for 1 round. This is a supernatural maneuver. Exploit: The creature becomes Vulnerable to damage which would pierce its damage reduction or be reduced or negated by its energy resistance/immunity. Alternatively, you can suppress other kinds of immunities, such as immunity to mind-affecting effects or poison. The creature may make a Will save (DC 17 + initiation modifier) to negate this exploit. If they succeed, the tricked condition is not removed as normal for an exploit, but instead halved.</p>"
