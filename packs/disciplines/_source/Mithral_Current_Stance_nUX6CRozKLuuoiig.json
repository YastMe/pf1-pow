      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: Two Mithral Current maneuvers<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Personal<br /><strong>Target</strong>: You<br /><strong>Duration</strong>: Stance</p><h2>Description</h2><p>You move with the speed and grace of a rapid flowing river, striking at blinding speeds. While you maintain this stance, any creature you hit with a melee attack must succeed at a Will save (DC 16 + your initiation modifier) or become vulnerable to silver until the end of your next turn. This effect resolves after your attack. In addition, you are considered to be threatening all squares within reach of your weapon even if it is sheathed, and can draw your weapon when making any type of maneuver or attack (including attacks of opportunity), even while flat-footed. You can sheath your weapon once per round as a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if it isn't your turn. Creatures with vulnerability to silver take 50% more damage from silver weapons.</p>"
