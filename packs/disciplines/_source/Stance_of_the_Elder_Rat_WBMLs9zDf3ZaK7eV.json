As long as you maintain this stance, all of your allies within 60 feet are granted your Teamwork feats. All tricked foes within this range are treated as though they had your Betrayal feats, and both you and your allies may use them as abettors. If an ally within range is maintaining a Roaring Mouse stance, they are treated as though they were maintaining this stance in addition to their actual stance.</p>"
