You can initiate this counter in response to being targeted by or caught in an effect that allows a saving throw. Make a Perform (dance) check in place of your saving throw. If you succeed, you can immediately move to any space adjacent to the creature that originated the effect without provoking attacks of opportunity, even if the creature is further away than your movement speed. If your weapon is sheathed when you initiate this maneuver, you may draw it and make a melee attack against that creature. If it hits, it deals weapon damage as normal plus an additional [[5d6]] points of damage.</p>"
