Choose either a grappled creature's arm or leg. You are treated as if you had succeeded at a called shot maneuver on the target and had dealt a debilitating blow to the limb and the target had failed their save by 5 or more. In addition, the target takes [[3d6]] points of bleed damage until a creature makes a Heal check (DC = 17 + your initiation modifier) to close the wound. Even if a creature lacks discernible arms or legs, you may still use this maneuver upon them to inflict the bleed damage, although the maneuver has no other effects.</p>"
