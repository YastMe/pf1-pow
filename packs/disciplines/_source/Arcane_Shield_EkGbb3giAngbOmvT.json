You can initiate this counter in response to a melee or ranged attack (including touch or ranged touch spell attacks) being made against you. Make a Spellcraft check, using your opponent's attack roll as the DC. If you succeed, the attack is negated. This is a force effect, and may be used to block incorporeal attacks. Animus augmentation: You may spend one point of animus to have the force shield crumble slowly after the attack rather than vanishing instantly, granting you a +2 shield bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn.</p>"
