While you maintain this stance, any square you threaten during your turn remains threatened by you until the end of your next turn. You can make melee attacks (including attacks of opportunity) against creatures within these squares, regardless of your actual location- a flickering glimpse of how you appeared the moment you threatened that square appears and makes the attack, just as if you were actually in the square. In addition, whenever a creature enters your threatened area, you can teleport to any unoccupied space within 10 feet of that creature as an immediate action.</p>"
